# MVVM-KOTLIN
Android application using MVVM to display a list of events from Ticketmaster.
Tapping add to favourite will move the event to the top of the list in a separate
“Favourites” section and also to the “Favourites Events” screen.

## Architecture
- Modularised: data, domain, and feature modules
- MVVM architecture pattern
- Jetpack Compose for UI

## What you should expect
- Display a list of the next 50 events in London from the [Ticketmaster API]
  (http://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/v2)
- MVVM architecture pattern
- Storing favourites events using Room DB
- DEBUG and RELEASE mode
- Handling screen rotation
- Swipe to refresh
- Project hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/uhconst/Ticket_Master.git)

## Important to notice
- In the <b>Favourites Screen</b> the app requests the API for each event using the event id. For some reason the API is returning sometimes *429 Too Many Requests*. To test that screen would be better having no more than 3 favourite events to avoid multiple calls and the API problem
